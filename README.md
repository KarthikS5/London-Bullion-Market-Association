# London-Bullion-Market-Association
London Bullion Market Associate
📊 Using the Real Dataset of the London Bullion Market Association (1968-2023), I embarked on an incredible data visualization adventure, discovering the power of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.
🎯 Here are the key highlights of my Power BI dashboard:
1️⃣ Data Exploration: I began by understanding Power BI as a tool and its versatile applications, familiarizing myself with its user-friendly interface.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: A real-world dataset is never perfect. I learned to filter, clean, and standardize the data using Power Editor, removing nulls, duplicates, and irrelevant information.
3️⃣ Visualization Mastery: Creating stunning charts, graphs, and scorecards is possible. I learned how to present complex data in an engaging and insightful manner.
4. Data Comparison: Leveraging the power of Power Query, I connected multiple datasets, performed merge and append operations, and used group by/split columns to gain meaningful insights.
5. Predictive Analytics: The true power of my dashboard lies in its ability to establish relationships in Power BI and uncover hidden trends and correlations, empowering data-driven decision-making.
